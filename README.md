## Best Practices

- Write Readable Code: Use meaningful variable names and consistent indentation to make your code easy to read and understand.
- Comment Your Code: Add comments to explain complex sections of your code or to remind yourself and others what specific parts of the code do.
- Modularize Your Code: Break down your code into functions and modules to improve reusability and organization.
- Test Frequently: Regularly test your code to catch and fix bugs early. This will save time and reduce frustration later on.
- Learn from Others: Review and learn from open-source Lua projects. Observing how others solve problems can provide valuable insights and techniques.
- Keep Up with Updates: Stay informed about updates and changes in Lua and Roblox Studio to ensure your skills and knowledge remain current.
