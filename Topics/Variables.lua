Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that prints out the following sentences:

    "Lua is a lightweight and efficient scripting language."
    "It is often used in embedded systems and game development."
    "Lua's syntax is simple and easy to learn, making it a popular choice for scripting."
    "One of Lua's strengths is its extensibility and integration with other languages."
    "Lua has a strong and supportive community, contributing to its widespread use."
    "The language is designed for flexibility and can be embedded in various applications."
    "Lua is known for its speed and small memory footprint."
    "Many popular software applications and games use Lua for scripting."
    "Lua supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms."
    "Overall, Lua is a versatile and powerful scripting language."

However, the provided code is incomplete and contains syntax errors. You need to fix these errors and complete the program so that it prints each sentence correctly. Use the provided variable names (sentence1, sentence2, ..., sentence10) to store the sentences. Make sure to assign each sentence to its respective variable and then print each variable.

Your task is to correct the code and ensure that it prints out all sentences as specified.    

--]] sentence1 = "Lua is a lightweight and efficient scripting language."
print(sentence1)

sentence2 = "It is often used in embedded systems and game development."
print(sentence2)

sentence3 =
    "Lua's syntax is simple and easy to learn, making it a popular choice for scripting."
print(sentence3)

sentence4 =
    "One of Lua's strengths is its extensibility and integration with other languages."
print(sentence4)

sentence5 =
    "Lua has a strong and supportive community, contributing to its widespread use."
print(sentence5)

sentence6 =
    "The language is designed for flexibility and can be embedded in various applications."
print(sentence6)

sentence7 = "Lua is known for its speed and small memory footprint."
print(sentence7)

sentence8 =
    "Many popular software applications and games use Lua for scripting."
print(sentence8)

sentence9 =
    "Lua supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms."
print(sentence9)

sentence10 = "Overall, Lua is a versatile and powerful scripting language."
print(sentence10)
